# falco-gke-audit-bridge

Falco has a powerful rule engine to monitor Kubernetes for suspicious activity.
Unfortunally this doesn't work with [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/), because GKE is currently not supporting [Dynamic Audit Webhook Backends](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/audit/#dynamic-backend).
GKE sends its audit logs by default to [Stackdriver](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/).

This tool will act as a bridge between the GKE Audit logs and Falco.
It uses Pub/Sub to receive the Audit event from Stackdriver almost in Real-time.
Then it convert the Audit Event from Stackdriver into an Kubernetes Audit Event and sends it to Falco.

# Setup
**falco-gke-audit-bridge** has a Docker image ready to deploy in Kubernetes.
* An example of deploying it in Kubernetes can be found in *deploy/kubernetes*.
* To configure the export of the Audit logs from Stackdriver via Pub/Sub to **falco-gke-audit-bridge**, see the Terraform example in *deploy/terraform*.

# Configure the Bridge
The **falco-gke-audit-bridge** can be configured through the following Environment Variables:

| Variable  | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
